title: "Allowlisting IP Addresses for Estuary"
description: "When configuring systems that interact with Estuary, it's crucial to ensure that the necessary IP addresses are allowlisted. This allows communication between Estuary and your data systems. The IP addresses you need to allowlist depend on the data plane you use."
---

## Data Plane IP Addresses[​](#data-plane-ip-addresses "Direct link to Data Plane IP Addresses")

You can find the IP addresses relevant to your use case in the **Admin** section of your dashboard. To do so:

1. On the **[Settings](https://dashboard.estuary.dev/admin/settings)** page, find the **Data Planes** section.

2. Choose between the **Private** and **Public** tabs [based on your use case](/getting-started/deployment-options/).

   Make sure to select the desired data plane when configuring a connector as well.

   If you wish to use a public data plane, Estuary offers several options across US and EU regions with AWS and GCP.

3. Find the **CIDR Blocks** column in the Data Planes table. This column includes a comma-separated list of IP addresses for that data plane.

   Ensure that these IP addresses are allowlisted on both the source and destination systems that interact with Estuary.

## IP Addresses to Allowlist[​](#ip-addresses-to-allowlist "Direct link to IP Addresses to Allowlist")
