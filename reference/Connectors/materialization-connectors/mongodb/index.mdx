[`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mongodb:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mongodb:dev) provides the latest connector image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Data model[​](#data-model "Direct link to Data model")

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. Its [data model](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/) consists of **documents** (lightweight records that contain mappings of fields and values) organized in **collections**. MongoDB documents have a mandatory `_id` field that is used as the key of the collection. Flow collection documents are materialized as MongoDB documents with an `_id` field value based on the Flow collection key.

<Info>
  If your Flow collection already has a field named `_id`, its value will be present in the materialized MongoDB document as the field `_flow_id` to prevent conflicts with the required `_id` field.
</Info>

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

You'll need:

* Credentials for connecting to your MongoDB instance and database.

* Read and write access to your MongoDB database and desired collections. See [Role-Based Access Control](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authorization/) for more information.

* If you are using MongoDB Atlas, or your MongoDB provider requires allowlisting of IPs, you need to [allowlist the Estuary IP addresses](/reference/allow-ip-addresses/).

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the Flow specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Firestore source connector.

### Sample[​](#sample "Direct link to Sample")

```
materializations:  ${PREFIX}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:    endpoint:      connector:        image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mongodb:dev        config:          address: "mongo:27017"          database: "test"          password: "flow"          user: "flow"    bindings:      - resource:          collection: users          database: test        source: ${PREFIX}/users
```

## SSH Tunneling[​](#ssh-tunneling "Direct link to SSH Tunneling")

As an alternative to connecting to your MongoDB instance directly, you can allow secure connections via SSH tunneling. To do so:

1. Refer to the [guide](/guides/connect-network/) to configure an SSH server on the cloud platform of your choice.

2. Configure your connector as described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, with the addition of the `networkTunnel` stanza to enable the SSH tunnel, if using. See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](/concepts/connectors/#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks) for additional details and a sample.

## Delta updates[​](#delta-updates "Direct link to Delta updates")

This connector supports both standard (merge) and [delta updates](/concepts/materialization/#delta-updates). The default is to use standard updates.
