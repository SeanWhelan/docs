description: "This connector materializes Flow collections into tables in a MySQL database."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mysql:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mysql:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To use this connector, you'll need:

* A MySQL database to which to materialize, and user credentials.

  * MySQL versions 5.7 and later are supported
  * The connector will create new tables in the database per your specification, so user credentials must have access to create new tables.
  * The `local_infile` global variable must be enabled. You can enable this setting by running `SET GLOBAL local_infile = true` in your database.

* At least one Flow collection

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

To meet these requirements, follow the steps for your hosting type.

* [Amazon RDS](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/MySQL/amazon-rds-mysql/)
* [Google Cloud SQL](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/MySQL/google-cloud-sql-mysql/)
* [Azure Database for MySQL](#azure-database-for-mysql)

In addition to standard MySQL, this connector supports cloud-based MySQL instances. Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Service, and Microsoft Azure are currently supported. You may use other cloud platforms, but Estuary doesn't guarantee performance.

To connect securely, you can either enable direct access for Flows's IP or use an SSH tunnel.

### Azure Database for MySQL[​](#azure-database-for-mysql "Direct link to Azure Database for MySQL")

You must configure your database to allow connections from Estuary. There are two ways to do this: by granting direct access to Flow's IP or by creating an SSH tunnel.

* **Connect Directly With Azure Database For MySQL**: Create a new [firewall rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/single-server/how-to-manage-firewall-using-portal) that grants access to the [Estuary Flow IP addresses](/reference/allow-ip-addresses/)

* **Connect With SSH Tunneling**: Follow the instructions for setting up an SSH connection to [Azure Database](/guides/connect-network/#setup-for-azure).

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

To use this connector, begin with data in one or more Flow collections. Use the below properties to configure a MySQL materialization, which will direct one or more of your Flow collections to your desired tables, or views, in the database.

### Setting the MySQL time zone[​](#setting-the-mysql-time-zone "Direct link to Setting the MySQL time zone")

MySQL's [`time_zone` server system variable](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_time_zone) is set to `SYSTEM` by default.

If you intend to materialize collections including fields of with `format: date-time` or `format: time`, and `time_zone` is set to `SYSTEM`, Flow won't be able to detect the time zone and convert datetimes to the appropriate timezone when materializing. To avoid this, you must explicitly set the time zone for your database.

You can:

* Specify a numerical offset from UTC.

  * For MySQL version 8.0.19 or higher, values from `-13:59` to `+14:00`, inclusive, are permitted.
  * Prior to MySQL 8.0.19, values from `-12:59` to `+13:00`, inclusive, are permitted

* Specify a named timezone in [IANA timezone format](https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

* If you're using Amazon Aurora, create or modify the [DB cluster parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBClusterParamGroups.html) associated with your MySQL database. [Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBClusterParamGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.ModifyingCluster) the `time_zone` parameter to the correct value.

For example, if you're located in New Jersey, USA, you could set `time_zone` to `-05:00` or `-04:00`, depending on the time of year. Because this region observes daylight savings time, you'd be responsible for changing the offset. Alternatively, you could set `time_zone` to `America/New_York`, and time changes would occur automatically.

If using IANA time zones, your database must include time zone tables. [Learn more in the MySQL docs](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/time-zone-support.html).

<Check>
  If you are unable to set the `time_zone` in the database and need to materialize collections with date-time or time fields, the materialization can be configured to assume a time zone using the `timezone` configuration property (see above). The `timezone` configuration property can be set as a numerical offset or IANA timezone format.

#### SSL Mode[​](#ssl-mode "Direct link to SSL Mode")

Possible values:

* `disabled`: A plain unencrypted connection is established with the server
* `preferred`: Only use SSL connection if the server asks for it
* `required`: Connect using an SSL connection, but do not verify the server's certificate.
* `verify_ca`: Connect using an SSL connection, and verify the server's certificate against the given SSL Server CA, but does not verify the server's hostname. This option is most commonly used when connecting to an IP address which does not have a hostname to be verified. When using this mode, SSL Server CA must be provided.
* `verify_identity`: Connect using an SSL connection, verify the server's certificate and the server's hostname. This is the most secure option. When using this mode, SSL Server CA must be provided.

Optionally, SSL Client Certificate and Key can be provided if necessary to authorize the client.

#### Bindings[​](#bindings "Direct link to Bindings")

| Property         | Title        | Description                                                                                                        | Type    | Required/Default |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ---------------- |
| **`/table`**     | Table        | Table name to materialize to. It will be created by the connector, unless the connector has previously created it. | string  | Required         |
| `/delta_updates` | Delta Update | Should updates to this table be done via delta updates.                                                            | boolean | `false`          |

### Sample[​](#sample "Direct link to Sample")

```
materializations:  ${PREFIX}/${mat_name}:    endpoint:      connector:        image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mysql:dev        config:          database: flow          address: localhost:5432          password: flow          user: flow    bindings:      - resource:          table: ${TABLE_NAME}        source: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```

## MySQL on managed cloud platforms[​](#mysql-on-managed-cloud-platforms "Direct link to MySQL on managed cloud platforms")

In addition to standard MySQL, this connector supports cloud-based MySQL instances. To connect securely, you can either enable direct access for Flows's IP or use an SSH tunnel.

Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Service, and Microsoft Azure are currently supported. You may use other cloud platforms, but Estuary doesn't guarantee performance.

### Setup[​](#setup-1 "Direct link to Setup")

You must configure your database to allow connections from Estuary. There are two ways to do this: by granting direct access to Flow's IP or by creating an SSH tunnel.

* **Connect directly with Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora**: Edit the VPC security group associated with your database instance, or create a new VPC security group and associate it with the database instance.

  1. [Modify the instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html), choosing **Publicly accessible** in the **Connectivity** settings.

  2. Per the [steps in the Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html#Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.Create), create a new inbound rule and a new outbound rule that allow all traffic from [Estuary's IP addresses](/reference/allow-ip-addresses/).

* **Connect directly with Google Cloud SQL**: [Enable public IP on your database](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ip#add) and add [Estuary Flow IP addresses](/reference/allow-ip-addresses/) as authorized IP addresses. See the instructions below to use SSH Tunneling instead of enabling public access.

* **Connect with SSH tunneling**

  1. Refer to the [guide](/guides/connect-network/) to configure an SSH server on the cloud platform of your choice.

  2. Configure your connector as described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, with the addition of the `networkTunnel` stanza to enable the SSH tunnel, if using. See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](/concepts/connectors/#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks) for additional details and a sample.

<Check>
  To configure the connector, you must specify the database address in the format `host:port`. (You can also supply `host` only; the connector will use the port `3306` by default, which is correct in many cases.) You can find the host and port in the following locations in each platform's console:

  * Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora: host as Endpoint; port as Port.
  * Google Cloud SQL: host as Private IP Address; port is always `3306`. You may need to [configure private IP](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip) on your database.
  * Azure Database: host as Server Name; port under Connection Strings (usually `3306`).
</Check>

## Delta updates[​](#delta-updates "Direct link to Delta updates")

This connector supports both standard (merge) and [delta updates](/concepts/materialization/#delta-updates). The default is to use standard updates.

## Date & times[​](#date--times "Direct link to Date & times")

Date and time fields that are part of collections, which specify a `format: date-time` for the field, are automatically converted to UTC and persisted as UTC `DATETIME` in MySQL.

## Reserved words[​](#reserved-words "Direct link to Reserved words")

MySQL has a list of reserved words that must be quoted in order to be used as an identifier. Flow considers all the reserved words in the official [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/keywords.html).

These reserved words are listed in the table below. Flow automatically quotes fields that are in this list.

| Reserved words  |                  |                 |                 |                 |
