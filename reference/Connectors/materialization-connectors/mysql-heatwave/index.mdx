| Property        | Title    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Type   | Required/Default |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| **`/address`**  | Address  | Host and port of the database. If only the host is specified, the port will default to `3306`.                                                                                                           | string | Required         |
| **`/database`** | Database | Name of the logical database to send data to.                                                                                                                                                            | string | Required         |
| **`/user`**     | User     | Username for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                             | string | Required         |
| **`/password`** | Password | Password for authentication.                                                                                                                                                                             | string | Required         |
| **`/timezone`** | Timezone | Timezone to use when materializing datetime columns. Should normally be left blank to use the database's 'time\_zone' system variable. Only required if the 'time\_zone' system variable cannot be read. | string |                  |

### Advanced: SSL Mode[​](#advanced-ssl-mode "Direct link to Advanced: SSL Mode")

Configuring the SSL mode strengthens security when transferring data to Oracle MySQL HeatWave. Here are the possible values for SSL mode:

* `disabled`: Establishes an unencrypted connection with the server.
* `preferred`: Initiates the SSL connection only if prompted by the server.
* `required`: Establishes an SSL connection but doesn’t verify the server’s certificate.
* `verify_ca`: Connects via SSL connection and verifies the server’s certificate against the provided SSL Server CA, without validating the server's hostname. SSL Server CA is mandatory for this mode.
* `verify_identity`: Ensures an SSL connection, and verifies both the server's certificate and hostname. This is the highest level of security. SSL Server CA is required for this mode.

### Bindings[​](#bindings "Direct link to Bindings")

| Property     | Title | Description                            | Type   | Required/Default |
| ------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| **`/table`** | Table | The name of the table to send data to. | string | Required         |

## Sample[​](#sample "Direct link to Sample")

```
materializations:  ${PREFIX}/${MAT_NAME}:    endpoint:      connector:        image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mysql-heatwave:dev        config:          database: flow          address: localhost:5432          password: secret          user: flow    bindings:      - resource:          table: ${TABLE_NAME}        source: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```

## MySQL HeatWave on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure[​](#mysql-heatwave-on-oracle-cloud-infrastructure "Direct link to MySQL HeatWave on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure")

This connector supports cloud-based MySQL HeatWave instances hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

### SSH Tunneling (Required)[​](#ssh-tunneling-required "Direct link to SSH Tunneling (Required)")

You are also required to configure SSH tunneling by providing the following:

* **SSH Endpoint**: Enter the endpoint of the remote SSH server that supports tunneling (formatted as `ssh://user@hostname[:port]`).
* **SSH Private Key**: Input the full RSA Private Key for SSH connection.
