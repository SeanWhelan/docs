description: "This connector materializes Flow collections into topics in Google Cloud Pub/Sub."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-google-pubsub:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-google-pubsub:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To use this connector, you'll need:

* A [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project) with the Google Pub/Sub API [enabled](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841?hl=en).
* Access to the project. Different items are required to configure access [using OAuth in the Flow web app](#oauth-authentication-using-the-flow-web-app) (recommended), and [configuring manually](#manual-authentication).
* At least one Flow collection to materialize.

  If you haven't yet captured your data from its external source, start at the beginning of the [guide to create a dataflow](/guides/create-dataflow/). You'll be referred back to this connector-specific documentation at the appropriate steps.

### OAuth authentication using the Flow web app[​](#oauth-authentication-using-the-flow-web-app "Direct link to OAuth authentication using the Flow web app")

OAuth is the simplest authentication method, and is supported in the Flow web app. You'll need:

* A Google account with the role [`roles/pubsub.editor`](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#roles) or equivalent for the Google Cloud project. See the [Google IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) to learn about granting roles.

You'll supply this account's username and password to authenticate.

### Manual authentication[​](#manual-authentication "Direct link to Manual authentication")

Manual authentication is the only method supported when using flowctl to develop locally. You'll need:

* A Google service account with the role [`roles/pubsub.editor`](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/access-control#roles) or equivalent for the Google Cloud project. See the [Google IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) to learn about granting roles.

* A JSON key for the service account.

See the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account#creatinganaccount) for help creating a new service account and generating its key.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

To use this connector, begin with data in one or more Flow collections. Use the below properties to configure a Google Cloud Pub/Sub materialization, which will direct one or more of your Flow collections to your desired Pub/Sub topics.

### Properties[​](#properties "Direct link to Properties")

#### Endpoint[​](#endpoint "Direct link to Endpoint")

| Property                        | Title                   | Description                                                                            | Type                                         | Required/Default |

| `/credentials/credentials_json` | Service Account JSON    | The JSON key of the service account to use for authorization, if configuring manually. | string                                       |                  |

#### Bindings[​](#bindings "Direct link to Bindings")

<Warning>
  PubSub topics need a [default subscription](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-topic#properties_of_a_topic); otherwise, delivered messages will be lost. Leave **Create with Default Subscription** set to the default, `true`, unless you have a specific reason not to do so.
</Warning>

| Property                           | Title                            | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Type    | Required/Default |

| `identifier`                       | Resource Binding Identifier      | Optional identifier for the resource binding if creating a [multiplex topic](#multiplex-topics). Included as "identifier" attribute in published messages if specified. | string  |                  |
| **`/topic`**                       | Topic Name                       | Name of the topic to publish materialized results to.                                                                                                                   | string  | Required         |

### Sample[​](#sample "Direct link to Sample")

This sample reflects the [manual authentication](#manual-authentication) method using the CLI.

```
materializations:  ${PREFIX}/${mat_name}:    endpoint:      connector:        config:          credentials:            auth_type: Service            credentials_json: {secret}          project_id: my_google_cloud_project    bindings:  	- resource:        create_default_subscription: true      	topic: my_new_topic      source: ${PREFIX}/${source_collection}
```

## Multiplex topics[​](#multiplex-topics "Direct link to Multiplex topics")

You can materialize multiple Flow collections to the same Pub/Sub topic. This is known as a **multiplex topic**. You do so by adding the optional `identifier` field to the [binding configuration](#bindings).

When materializing to a multiplex topic, ensure that:

* The bindings you want to combine have the same `topic` name.
* Each binding pulls from a different Flow collection
* Each binding has a unique `identifier`. It can be anything you'd like.

The binding configuration will look similar to:

```
bindings:  - resource:      identifier: one      topic: multiplex-topic    source: ${PREFIX}/source_collection_one  - resource:      identifier: two      topic: multiplex-topic    source: ${PREFIX}/source_collection_two
```

## Delta updates[​](#delta-updates "Direct link to Delta updates")

Because Google Cloud Pub/Sub is a write-only event-streaming system, this connector uses only [delta updates](/concepts/materialization/#delta-updates).

## Message ordering[​](#message-ordering "Direct link to Message ordering")

Google Cloud Pub/Sub manages message ordering using [ordering keys](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).

This connector sets the ordering key of published messages using the Flow [collection key](/concepts/collections/#keys) of the documents being being published. Messages are published in order, on a per-key basis.
