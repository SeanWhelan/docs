title: "Pinecone"
description: "This connector materializes Flow collections into namespaces in a Pinecone index."
---

The connector uses the [OpenAI Embedding API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) to create vector embeddings based on the documents in your collections and inserts these vector embeddings and associated metadata into Pinecone for storage and retrieval.

[`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-pinecone:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-pinecone:dev) provides the latest connector image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To use this connector, you'll need:

* A [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) account with an [API Key](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/quickstart#2-get-and-verify-your-pinecone-api-key) for authentication.
* An [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account with an [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for authentication.
* A [Pinecone Index](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/indexes) created to store materialized vector embeddings. When using the embedding model `text-embedding-ada-002` (recommended), the index must have `Dimensions` set to 1536.

## Embedding Input[​](#embedding-input "Direct link to Embedding Input")

The materialization creates a vector embedding for each collection document. Its structure is based on the collection fields.

By default, fields of a single scalar type are including in the embedding: strings, integers, numbers, and booleans. You can include additional array or object type fields using [projected fields](/concepts/materialization/#projected-fields).

The text generated for the embedding has this structure, with field names and their values separated by newlines:

```
stringField: stringValueintField: 3numberField: 1.2boolField: false
```

## Pinecone Record Metadata[​](#pinecone-record-metadata "Direct link to Pinecone Record Metadata")

Pinecone supports metadata fields associated with stored vectors that can be used when performing [vector queries](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-search-filtering/). This materialization will include the materialized document as a JSON string in the metadata field `flow_document` to enable retrieval of the document from vectors returned by Pinecone queries.

Pinecone indexes all metadata fields by default. To manage memory usage of the index, use [selective metadata indexing](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/manage-indexes#selective-metadata-indexing) to exclude the `flow_document` metadata field.

## Delta Updates[​](#delta-updates "Direct link to Delta Updates")

This connector operates only in [delta updates](/concepts/materialization/#delta-updates) mode.

Pinecone [upserts](https://docs.pinecone.io/reference/upsert) vectors based on their `id`. The `id` for materialized vectors is based on the Flow Collection key.

For collections with a a top-level reduction strategy of [merge](/reference/reduction-strategies/merge/) and a strategy of [lastWriteWins](/reference/reduction-strategies/firstwritewins-and-lastwritewins/) for all nested values (this is also the default), collections will be materialized "effectively once", with any updated Flow documents replacing vectors in the Pinecone index if they have the same key.
