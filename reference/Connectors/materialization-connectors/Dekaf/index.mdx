description: "This connector materializes Flow collections as Kafka-compatible messages that Kafka consumers can read."

If you want to send messages to your own Kafka broker, see the [Kafka](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/apache-kafka/) materialization connector instead.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To use this connector, you'll need:

* At least one Flow collection
* At least one Kafka consumer

## Variants[​](#variants "Direct link to Variants")

Dekaf can be used with a number of systems that act as Kafka consumers. Specific instructions are provided for the following systems:

* [Bytewax](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/bytewax/)
* [ClickHouse](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/clickhouse/)
* [Imply Polaris](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/imply-polaris/)
* [Materialize](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/materialize/)
* [SingleStore](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/singlestore/)
* [Startree](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/startree/)
* [Tinybird](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/tinybird/)
* [RisingWave](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/risingwave/)

For other use cases, continue with the setup details below for general instruction.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

Provide an auth token when setting up the Dekaf connector. This can be a password of your choosing and will be used to authenticate consumers to your Kafka topics.

Once the connector is created, note the full materialization name, such as `YOUR-ORG/YOUR-PREFIX/YOUR-MATERIALIZATION`. You will use this as the username.

You may then connect to a Kafka consumer of your choice using the following details:

* **Broker Address**: `dekaf.estuary-data.com:9092`
* **Schema Registry Address**: `https://dekaf.estuary-data.com`
* **Security Protocol**: `SASL_SSL`
* **SASL Mechanism**: `PLAIN`
* **SASL Username**: The full name of your materialization
* **SASL Password**: The auth token you specified
* **Schema Registry Username**: The full name of your materialization
* **Schema Registry Password**: The auth token you specified

To subscribe to a particular topic, use a binding's topic name. By default, this will be the collection name.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

To use this connector, begin with data in one or more Flow collections. Use the below properties to configure a Dekaf materialization, which will direct one or more of your Flow collections to your desired topics.
