description: "This connector captures data from Google Analytics 4 properties into Flow collections via the ."
---

It’s available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-google-analytics-data-api-native:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-google-analytics-data-api-native:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

The following data resources are supported:

* Daily active users
* Devices
* Four-weekly active users
* Locations
* Pages
* Traffic sources
* Website overview
* Weekly active users

Each is [fetched as a report](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/properties/runReport) and mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

You can also capture [custom reports](#custom-reports).

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To use this connector, you'll need:

* The Google Analytics Data API [enabled](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841?hl=en) on your Google [project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects) with which your Analytics property is associated. (Unless you actively develop with Google Cloud, you'll likely just have one option).

* Your Google Analytics 4 [property ID](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id#what_is_my_property_id).

## Authentication[​](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

Your Google username and password is required to authenticate the connector using OAuth2.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing a specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Google Analytics Data API source connector.

### Properties[​](#properties "Direct link to Properties")

#### Endpoint[​](#endpoint "Direct link to Endpoint")

The following properties reflect the manual authentication method. If you authenticate directly with Google in the Flow web app, some of these properties aren't required.

### Custom reports[​](#custom-reports "Direct link to Custom reports")

You can include data beyond the [default data resources](#supported-data-resources) with Custom Reports. These replicate the functionality of [Custom Reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10445879?hl=en) in the Google Analytics Web console.

Custom reports must have between 1 - 9 dimensions and 1 - 10 metrics.

Fill out the Custom Reports property with a JSON array as a string with the following schema:

```
[{"name": "<report-name>", "dimensions": ["<dimension-name>", ...], "metrics": ["<metric-name>", ...]}]
```

[Filters](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/FilterExpression#Filter) are also supported. See Google's documentation for [examples](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/basics#filter) of filters and valid [filter syntax](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/FilterExpression).

```
[{"name": "<report-name>", "dimensions": ["<dimension-name>", ...], "metrics": ["<metric-name>", ...], "dimensionFilter": "<filter-object>", "metricFilter": "<another-filter-object>"}]
```

The `TOTAL`, `MAXIMUM`, and `MINIMUM` [metric aggregations](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1beta/MetricAggregation) are supported as well. These aggregates will be emitted as separate documents with the dimension values indicating the type of aggregation, like `RESTRICTED_TOTAL`.

```
[{"name": "<report-name>", "dimensions": ["<dimension-name>", ...], "metrics": ["<metric-name>", ...], "metricAggregations": ["TOTAL", "MAXIMUM", "MINIMUM"]}]
```

<Check>
  After editing custom reports for a capture, always [re-discover](/concepts/captures/#discovery) bindings to ensure the changes to your custom reports are reflected in the associated collections' specs and schemas.

## Performance considerations[​](#performance-considerations "Direct link to Performance considerations")

### Data sampling[​](#data-sampling "Direct link to Data sampling")

The Google Analytics Data API enforces compute thresholds for ad-hoc queries and reports. If a threshold is exceeded, the API will apply sampling to limit the number of sessions analyzed for the specified time range. These thresholds can be found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192?hl=en\&ref_topic=2601030\&visit_id=637868645346124317-2833523666\&rd=1#thresholds\&zippy=%2Cin-this-article). If your account is on the Analytics 360 tier, you're less likely to run into these limitations.
