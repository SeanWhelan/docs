title: "Exchange Rates API"
description: "This connector captures data from the . It creates a Flow collection with daily exchange rate data for a variety of supported currencies. This simple connector is useful for educational and demonstration purposes."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-exchange-rates:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-exchange-rates:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* An API key generated through an [Exchange Rate API account](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/description/exchangerates_data-api?preview=true#pricing). After you sign up, your API key can be found on your account page.
  * You may use the free account, but note that you'll be limited to the default base currency, EUR.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors.

```
captures:  ${PREFIX}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:    endpoint:      connector:        image: ghcr.io/estuary/source-exchange-rates:dev        config:            base: EUR            access_key: <secret>            start_date: 2022-01-01            ignore_weekends: true    bindings:      - resource:           stream: exchange_rates           syncMode: incremental        target: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```

This capture definition should only have one binding, as `exchange_rates` is the only available data stream.
