description: "This connector captures data from Iterate into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-iterate:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-iterate:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

The following data resources are supported through the Iterate API:

* [Surveys](https://iterate.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0//surveys)
* [Survey Responses](https://iterate.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0//surveys/%7Bid%7D/responses)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* An Iterate [API access token](https://iterate.docs.apiary.io/#introduction/overview/authentication)

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Iterate source connector.
