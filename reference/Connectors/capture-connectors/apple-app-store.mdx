## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To use this connector, you'll need:

* An Apple Developer account with access to App Store Connect.
* App Store Connect API access approved by your Account Holder.
* An App Store Connect API key with Admin permissions (required for Analytics Reports).

## Authentication[​](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

An App Store Connect API key is required to authenticate the connector. The connector uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with your private API key. To create an API key:

1. Sign in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Navigate to Users and Access > Integrations
3. Create a new API key with **Admin** permissions (required for Analytics Reports)
4. Download the private key (.p8 file) - this can only be done once
5. Note your Key ID and Issuer ID

Please refer to Apple's [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating-api-keys-for-app-store-connect-api) for detailed steps on creating API keys.

<Info>
  Admin-level permissions are required to access Analytics Reports. Only Account Holders can initially request API access.
