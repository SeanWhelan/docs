---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-dynamics-365-finance-and-operations:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-dynamics-365-finance-and-operations:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

This connector captures changes to Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations tables that are exported to Azure Data Lake Storage. All available tables will appear after authenticating and performing a discovery.

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* A Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations account
* An Azure Synapse Link that exports Finance and Operations data into Azure Data Lake Storage in CSV format. See Microsoft's [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-select-fno-data) for instructions on how to set up the exports with Azure Synapse Link.
* The Azure container and filesystem containing the exported data.

<Note>
  Azure Synapse Link supports exporting data in either CSV or Parquet format. This connector currently only works with CSVs, so ensure the CSV export option is chosen.

  If you would like to capture data in Parquet format, please reach out to us with that request.
</Note>

### Authentication[​](#authentication "Direct link to Authentication")

Authentication with the Azure Data Lake Storage containing your Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations data is done with a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token. See Microsoft's [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/document-translation/how-to-guides/create-sas-tokens?tabs=Containers) for instructions on how to create SAS tokens.

When creating the SAS token, ensure the following settings are configured:

* Under the **Allowed services** section, choose **Blob**.
* Under the **Allowed resource types** section, choose **Container** and **Object**.
* Under the **Allowed permissions** section, choose **Read** and **List**.

<Warning>
  SAS tokens have an expiration date and they cannot be renewed. When your SAS token expires, make sure to update your capture with a new SAS token.
</Warning>

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification files. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations source connector.
