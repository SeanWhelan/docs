It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-youtube-analytics:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-youtube-analytics:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
