description: "This connector captures data from Monday.com into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-monday:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-monday:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

The following data resources are supported through the Monday.com API:

* [Boards](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/boards)
* [Items](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/items)
* [Users](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/users)
* [Teams](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/teams)
* [Tags](https://developer.monday.com/api-reference/reference/tags)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Monday.com supports two authentication methods: OAuth and API token. The API token method is the only supported method; however, OAuth will be supported in the future.

### API Token Authentication[​](#api-token-authentication "Direct link to API Token Authentication")

Each Monday.com user account has an unique API token that can be accessed in the Monday.com web app by going to the Avatar menu > Developers tab > My access tokens. See [Monday.com's documentation](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/choosing-auth#method-3-using-a-users-global-api-token) for more information.

### OAuth Authentication[​](#oauth-authentication "Direct link to OAuth Authentication")

Coming soon.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Monday source connector.

### Properties[​](#properties "Direct link to Properties")
