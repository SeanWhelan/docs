title: "Klaviyo (deprecated)"
description: "This connector captures data from Klaviyo into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-klaviyo:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-klaviyo:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

This connector can be used to sync the following tables from Klaviyo:

* [Campaigns](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-campaigns#get-campaigns)
* [Events](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/metrics-timeline)
* [GlobalExclusions](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-global-exclusions)
* [Lists](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-lists)
* [Metrics](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-metrics)
* [Flows](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/get_flows)
* [Profiles](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/get_profiles)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* To set up the Klaviyo source connector, you'll need the [Klaviyo Private API key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267-How-to-Manage-Your-Account-s-API-Keys#your-private-api-keys3).

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Klaviyo source connector.
