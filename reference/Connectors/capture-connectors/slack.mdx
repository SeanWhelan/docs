It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-slack:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-slack:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

The following data resources are supported through the Slack APIs:

* [Channels (Conversations)](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list)
* [Channel Members (Conversation Members)](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.members)
