description: "This connector captures data from Greenhouse into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-greenhouse:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-greenhouse:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

- To set up the Greenhouse source connector, you'll need the [Harvest API key](https://developers.greenhouse.io/harvest.html#authentication) with permissions to the resources Estuary should be able to access.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Greenhouse source connector.
