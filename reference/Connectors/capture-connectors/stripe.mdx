title: "Stripe (Deprecated)"
description: "This connector captures data from Stripe into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-stripe:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-stripe:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

<Warning>
  This connector is deprecated. See the [Stripe Real-time](/reference/Connectors/capture-connectors/stripe-realtime/) connector for the latest Stripe integration.
</Warning>

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Stripe source connector.

### Choosing your start date and lookback window[​](#choosing-your-start-date-and-lookback-window "Direct link to Choosing your start date and lookback window")

The connector will continually capture data beginning on the **Replication start date** you choose.

However, some data from the Stripe API is mutable; for example, [a draft invoice can be completed](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/invoice-states) at a later date than it was created. To account for this, it's useful to set the **Lookback Window**. When this is set, at a given point in time, the connector will not only look for new data; it will also capture changes made to data within the window.

For example, if you start the connector with the start date of `2022-06-06T00:00:00Z` (June 6) and the lookback window of `3`, the connector will begin to capture data starting from June 3. As time goes on while the capture remains active, the lookback window rolls forward along with the current timestamp. On June 10, the connector will continue to monitor data starting from June 7 and capture any changes to that data, and so on.
