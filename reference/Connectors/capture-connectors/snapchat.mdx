description: "This connector captures data from Snapchat Marketing into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-snapchat:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-snapchat:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

This connector can be used to sync the following tables from Snapchat:

* Adaccounts
* Ads
* Adsquads
* Campaigns
* Creatives
* Media
* Organizations
* Segments
* AdaccountsStatsHourly
* AdaccountsStatsDaily
* AdaccountsStatsLifetime
* AdsStatsHourly
* AdsStatsDaily
* AdsStatsLifetime
* AdsquadsStatsDaily
* AdsquadsStatsLifetime
* CampaignsStatsHourly
* CampaignsStatsDaily
* CampaignsStatsLifetime

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* A Snapchat Marketing account with permission to access data from accounts you want to sync.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Snapchat source connector.
