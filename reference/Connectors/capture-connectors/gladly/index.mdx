description: "This connector captures data from Gladly into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-gladly:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-gladly:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

This connector can be used to sync the following [Event entity types](https://developer.gladly.com/rest/#tag/Events) from Gladly:

* **AGENT\_AVAILABILITY**
* **AGENT\_STATUS**
* **CONTACT**
* **CONVERSATION**
* **CUSTOMER**
* **PAYMENT\_REQUEST**
* **TASK**

By default, each entity type is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

To set up the Gladly source connector, you'll need a Gladly account with an [API token](https://connect.gladly.com/docs/implementation/article/get-your-api-tokens/).

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
