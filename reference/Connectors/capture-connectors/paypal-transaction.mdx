title: "Paypal Transaction"
description: "This connector captures data from Paypal Transaction into Flow collections."
---

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-paypal-transaction:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-paypal-transaction:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

## Supported data resources[​](#supported-data-resources "Direct link to Supported data resources")

The following data resources are supported through the Paypal APIs:

* [Transactions](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#transactions)
* [Balances](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#balances)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* The [Paypal Transaction API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/) is used to get the history of transactions for a PayPal account.

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors.
