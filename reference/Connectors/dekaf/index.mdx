## Using Kafka or Dekaf[​](#using-kafka-or-dekaf "Direct link to Using Kafka or Dekaf")

Estuary provides multiple options for integrating with a Kafka ecosystem. Which option you choose may depend on how much of the Kafka ecosystem you manage and how you are working with your data.

## Available Dekaf integrations[​](#available-dekaf-integrations "Direct link to Available Dekaf integrations")

Dekaf is compatible with many Kafka consumers. For instructions on integrating with specific systems, choose from the following materialization connectors.

* [Bytewax](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/bytewax/)
* [ClickHouse](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/clickhouse/)
* [Imply Polaris](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/imply-polaris/)
* [Materialize](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/materialize/)
* [SingleStore](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/singlestore/)
* [Startree](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/startree/)
* [Tinybird](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/tinybird/)

You may use the [generic Dekaf materialization connector](/reference/Connectors/materialization-connectors/Dekaf/) for other use cases.
