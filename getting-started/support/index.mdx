## Grant data sharing access for troubleshooting[​](#grant-data-sharing-access-for-troubleshooting "Direct link to Grant data sharing access for troubleshooting")

During certain troubleshooting sessions, it can be helpful for a member of the Estuary team to have access to your tenant data. An Estuary team member may request an access grant to help you manage your pipelines at these times.

<Warning>
  Estuary will *only* ever request access for the `estuary_support/` prefix.
</Warning>

You can temporarily grant Estuary access using the following steps:

1. Go to the [Admin page](https://dashboard.estuary.dev/admin/) in your Estuary dashboard.

2. Under the **Account Access** tab, find the **Data Sharing** table.

3. Select **Grant Access** and fill out the following details in the **Share Data** modal:

   * **Shared Prefix:** your tenant prefix
   * **Shared With:** `estuary_support/`
   * **Capability:** may depend on the troubleshooting session, but typically `admin`

4. Click **Grant Access** to confirm.

You should then see `estuary_support/` in the list of entities that you're sharing data with.

When your issue is resolved, you can revoke access again by selecting the `estuary_support/` row and clicking **Remove**.
