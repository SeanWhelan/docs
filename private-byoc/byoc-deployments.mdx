description: "Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) deployments are similar to  while allowing users even more control over their data. With this deployment option, you create and own the data plane that Estuary deploys to."

You will need to create a separate account or subscription in your cloud provider and region of choice for this data plane. Estuary will require access to manage resources within the account, including resource creation and destruction, updates, patches, and scaling inside your VPC. While you retain ownership over your resources, your BYOC deployment therefore comes with complete data plane management.

You can connect this account and your main account using PrivateLink or an equivalent service.

  You'll need a license for a BYOC deployment. [Reach out to an Estuary representative](mailto:support@estuary.dev) to start the process.

While this option requires more user setup and management, it is also the most customizable and most isolated option.

## Features[​](#features "Direct link to Features")

BYOC shares many features with [private deployments](/private-byoc/private-deployments/#features). In addition, you get:

* **Infrastructure control:** With a BYOC deployment, you have complete control over your cloud infrastructure and can manage it according to your company's policies.

* **Leverage existing cloud resources:** Use your current cloud setup. This can be especially beneficial if you have already invested heavily in your cloud architecture.

* **Cost savings:** Since BYOC uses your existing cloud setup, you likewise may be able to make use of existing cloud credits or negotiated rates.

* **Customization:** Fit specific organizational needs by customizing Flow's deployment.
